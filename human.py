# if the score > 0 (positive):
  # Remove all present letters from consideration of SUSPICION
  # proceed with main function
# elif score < 0 (negative):
  # Remove all letters not present from consideration of SUSPICION
  # proceed with main function
# else (score == 0):
  # Remove all letter present from consideration of TRUST



# How does the main function proceed? At random?
# Of all the letters that are currently in the running for each category, brute force by applying every possible combination of available letters and find the configurations that are valid?
# Ton of combinations to go through, especially at the beginning, but that is one possible option.
